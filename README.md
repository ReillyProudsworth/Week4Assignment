# Week4Assignment

This is a single script called 'run_analysis.R' which should be placed in the 'UCI HAR Dataset' directory with the Samsung data in 
their original 'test' and 'train' directories and 'feature names.txt' file.  The script will pull in some data about feature names, 
then move into both the 'test' and 'train' directories before moving back to the original working directory and outputting a tidy 
data file called 'Acclerometer_Tidy_Data.txt'.
